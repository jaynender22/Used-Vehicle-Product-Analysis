  This report analyzes the factors influencing used car prices in the US and UK. Using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, numpy, and sklearn, we examined key features—brand, model, transmission type, fuel type, year, mileage, engine size, and mpg—to identify pricing trends. Before conducting our analysis, we cleaned the data, merged the US and UK datasets, and consulted external resources on used car pricing to form hypotheses and provide context. Our goal is to assist sellers in both countries with setting competitive prices based on the unique attributes of their vehicles. We developed a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a used car based on its features, streamlining this complex process for sellers. Ultimately, our goal is to provide insights that help sellers achieve the highest possible sale prices, maximizing their profits. The most popular car brands in our dataset are Ford, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Vauxhall, and BMW. Our analysis shows that transmission, year, and engine size have the strongest linear correlations with price, with engine size exhibiting significant variability, likely due to luxury and high-performance models. This idea can be substantiated by the feature importance graph dervied from the ML model. However, features like mileage and mpg were also important to forcasting price.
On average, US cars are more expensive than UK cars. Additionally, petrol and diesel vehicles are predominantly manual, while hybrid cars are mostly automatic. Hybrid cars are priced only slightly higher than petrol or diesel vehicles on average, offering moderate accessibility to consumers. With customers willing to pay a higher price for more sustainable fuel, there is an opportunity for hybrid car market growth, which could help reduce the dominance of petrol and diesel cars and mitigate their environmental impact.
